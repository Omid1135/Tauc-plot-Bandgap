## Tauc Plot for Bandgap Determination

### Overview
This Python Jupyter Notebook provides a tool for determining the bandgap of a material using the Tauc plot method. The project includes an Excel template for data preparation (wavelength (nm) and absorption coefficient) and a novel algorithm for accurate bandgap estimation.

### Features
* Excel template for data input
* Innovative Tauc plot algorithm with python programming
* User-friendly Jupyter Notebook interface

### How to Use
1. Prepare your absorption data using the provided Excel template.
2. Use this file and Tauc-Plot-Bandgap.ipynb.
3. Run the different cells of the code to generate the Tauc plot and calculate the bandgap.
4. Analyze the results.

### Dependencies
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* scipy.optimize

### Usage Example
Tauc-Plot-Bandgap.ipynb and Raw wavelength_absorption_data.xlsx
